		<h1>Welcome to Shiva's Favorite Communists!</h1>
			<p>I'll be telling you about some of my favorite proletarian revolutionaries here.</p>

			<h2>Vladimir Lenin</h2>

				height="163" alt = "The great Lenin."><br><p>Born in blah blah blah, he lead the Bolsheviks to seize power after the end of the Russian Civil War and helped establish the world's very first proletarian state. A foundational head of Marxism, he was also an excellent scholar, theorist, and organizer.</p>

				<p><em>Based level: one trillion</em></p>

			<h2>Mao Zedong</h2>

He helped bring Marxism-Leninism to a new level with contributions such as people's war and cultural revolution.</p>
